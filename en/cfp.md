## Call for Papers: Text simplification and adaptation

### Important Dates

**Submissions: 06 March 2022**

**Notification: 08 March 2022**

**Workshop: 25 March 2022**

### Context

Text simplification is used in the field of translation (pre-editing), localization and technical writing. Pre-editing is the process by which a human prepares a document before applying machine translation in order to achieve better results and reduce post-editing workload, which has become a common choice for companies publishing their content in different languages.

In addition, text simplification improves natural language processing applications, including machine translation results. Thus, automatic text simplification could be useful in various fields such as science communication, science journalism, politics and education, both for science courses and for didactics. Science popularisation and science journalism is one of UNESCO's oldest programmes.

Simplified texts are also more accessible to non-native speakers, young readers, people with reading disabilities or with lower levels of education (Sustainable Development Goal REDUCED INEQUALITY). 
Scientific texts, such as research publications, can be difficult to understand for non-experts in the field or scientists who are not involved in the publication. Improving the comprehensibility of texts and adapting them to different audiences remains an unsolved problem. Simplification of texts is a step forward to make research truly open, accessible and understandable to everyone, to develop a counter-discourse to fake news based on scientific results, to allow people to read more quickly and consequently become more aware of scientific results, especially with an explosion of open science during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Sustainable Development Goal QUALITY EDUCATION).

The aim of this issue of the workshop is to provide a communication platform for an interdisciplinary community of researchers in translation, technical writing, natural language processing, information retrieval, linguistics, didactics, science journalism and science popularisation. 

Mots/Machines-2022 is the fourth issue of the workshop organised by the HCTI lab (Héritages et Constructions dans le Texte et l'Image).

### Submission Guidelines

Submissions should be written in English or French following the [CEURART](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/) 1-column paper style and be submitted as PDF files via the [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=motsmachines2021) system. 
The papers should be original, i.e. not published in an earlier workshop or conference or journal, except for extended abstracts. Literature reviews, position and demo papers, papers on ongoing work or negative results are welcomed. Translations of previously published works can be accepted as extended abstracts.

We accept the following types of submissions:

1. *Extended abstracts* of 500-1000 words with bibliographic references. Bibliographic references are excluded from word count. Previously published papers can be accepted as extended abstracts (please, provide a reference to your previous work in this case).
2. *Regular papers* of 10-12 standard pages length with an appropriate number of references.
3. *Short papers* of 5-6 standard pages length with additional pages for references.
