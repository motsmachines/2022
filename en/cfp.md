## Call for Papers: Text simplification and adaptation

### Important Dates

**Submissions: 06 March 2022**

**Notification: 08 March 2022**

**Workshop: 25 March 2022**

Text simplification is used in the field of translation, localization and technical writing. Pre-editing is the process by which a human prepares a document before using machine translation in order to achieve better results and reduce post-editing workload, which has become a common choice for companies publishing their content in different languages.

In addition, text simplification can improve natural language processing applications, including machine translation results. Thus, automatic text simplification could be useful in various fields such as science communication, science journalism, politics and education, both for science courses and didactics. Science popularization and science journalism is one of UNESCO's oldest programs.

Simplified texts are also more accessible to non-native speakers, young readers, people with reading disabilities or with lower levels of education (Sustainable Development Goal REDUCED INEQUALITY). Scientific texts, such as research publications, can be difficult to understand for non-experts in the field or scientists who are not involved in the publication. Improving the comprehensibility of texts and adapting them to different audiences remains an unsolved problem. Simplification of texts is a step forward to make research truly open, accessible and understandable to everyone, to develop a counter-discourse to fake news based on scientific results, to allow people to read more quickly and consequently become more aware of scientific results, especially with an explosion of open science during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Sustainable Development Goal QUALITY EDUCATION).

Mots/Machines-2022 is the fourth issue of the workshop organised by the HCTI lab (Héritages et Constructions dans le Texte et l'Image).
